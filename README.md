#Online Shopping Store

#The Foundation (Backend): 
Built with Django, Django takes care of things like keeping track of your products, and making sure everything runs smoothly.
The Database (SQLite):Stores product details, pictures.Since we're starting small, the lightweight SQLite database is a good choice, like a filing cabinet that fits neatly in a corner.

#The Look and Feel (Frontend): 
This is the pretty part that customers see: the product listings, shopping cart, and overall design. Here's where the fun stuff comes in:

#JavaScript: 
Adds interactivity, like letting customers add items to their cart without refreshing the page.

#Bootstrap: 
This pre-made set of styles and layouts acts like pre-built furniture for your house. It makes creating a nice-looking and responsive storefront (one that works well on phones and computers) much faster.

#CSS: 
This is like the paint and wallpaper - it controls the colors, fonts, and overall styling of your storefront.

#HTML: 
This is the basic building block of your webpages, like the walls and floors of your house. It provides the structure and content that everything else sits on.
